## Welcome to WorldFixing Web Site

Welcome to our World Fixing Web site here at GitHub. Our goal is to Fix many of the global issues, including World Poverty and now the most urgent Issue: Global Warming - a major aspect of Climate Change.

Please check out our Repository: fixing-global-warming where we propose a very Simple yet Guaranteed strategy to reduce Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere, at a level consistent with the reductions proposed by IPCC in their Oct 8, 2018 Report. 

If you see merit in this Solution, please Share with friends and associates.
