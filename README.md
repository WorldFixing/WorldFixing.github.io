Our New Web Site at GitHub is helping us get familiar with maintaining code,
programs and systems in an organized fashion. To date, we created
this web site and added a slide show we prepared earlier outlining the 
Project to reduce CO2 in the Atmosphere to allow the world to catch up
with new technology that will truly be Sustainable and non-Polluting.

If you agree with some of what we are doing, please Share with others,
that is one of the Secrets of this New Paradigm - Sharing...
We are seeking contributors to help in all aspects of this endeavour,
please contact us, we have a lot to do...
